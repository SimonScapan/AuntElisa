# Seq2Se2 Models
Here you are able to read a short description about the two different training files and how to use the different models.

## Model 1
While training this model, we reached negative probabilities. So we had to stop th training after epoche 29. More informations about this approach are documented in the project report.
If you want to try the model anyway, you have to download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Wye2qLMIkrWpGFL0dcdSIaJVQuqD5T2/view?usp=sharing)  into the directory "model1" and start the file "use_chatbot.py" in this directory. Unfortunately the model was too large to store in github.

"idxm.npy", "idxr.npy" and "metadate.pkl" are the results of the preprocessing.
