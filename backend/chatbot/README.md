# Seq2Seq Models
Here you are able to read a short description about the two different training files and how to use the different models.

## Model 1
While training this model, we reached negative probabilities. So we had to stop th training after epoche 29. More informations about this approach are documented in the project report.
If you want to try using the model anyway, you have to download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Wye2qLMIkrWpGFL0dcdSIaJVQuqD5T2/view?usp=sharing) into the directory "model1" and start the file "use_chatbot.py" in this directory. Unfortunately the model was too large to store in github.

"idxm.npy", "idxr.npy" and "metadate.pkl" are the results of the preprocessing.

As this approach is not the offical approach we are handing in as the result of our project, this file is not completely cleaned up. We just want to provide the opprtuinity to follow the steps we did in the development of the project.

### Model 2
Model 2 is our offical approach wich is also implemented in the frontend. To use this model you have to download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qkqUJqsTw3lYPvoIKi1xJLhdjgPWzu9b?usp=sharing), put the 4 files into the following directory: model_2/training/model and start the frontend as discribed [here](https://github.com/SimonScapan/AuntElisa).

Additional information about the functionality and the developemnt of this model are documented in the project report.

As this approach is the offical approach we are handing in as the result of our project, this file is cleaned up and structured in the different steps of development.
